## About

The website has a selection of calculus questions, (classified by age, subject and difficulty), where you can register as a teacher. The teacher will be able to:

## A

pull questions from the database to create a test.

## B

create a group of students, and send the test to the group.

## C

Add questions to the question database.

Every student will be able to log in and access the test on the website (he receives a link by email).

The teacher will receive an overall report - grade for each student, execution time, an unusual question that what percentage of the class failed, a question that took a lot of time.

In exceptional cases, the site administrator changes the details of the failing questions.
